## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - ViteJS
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my first project created using Typescript and Vite. A TypeScript feature I used was interfaces. I learnt that interfaces and types are very similar in use case although they have certain differences.

```js
export interface userData {
  name: string;
  avatar: string;
  content: string;
  post?: string;
  picture?: string;
  time: string;
  message?: string;
  group?: string;
  read: boolean;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Tyepscript Lang](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#example/types-vs-interfaces) - This helped me get an understanding between the differences between types and interfaces. It is a very detailed, concise overview of them both.
